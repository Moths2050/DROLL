This repo provides the source code of our paper: Dual-domain Reconstruction Network with a High-fidelity Domain-transform Operator based on Learned Low-rank Prior for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction. 

The full code will be published after the acceptance of the paper

## FanBeam_BP_cuda_lib
This  is a library of microprojectable backprojection operators for defining forward and backprojection processes for fanbeam X-ray.
```python
python setup.py install
```

## GenerateDataSet
This code is used to simulate forward projection and FBP reconstruction of 2D images.
```python
python Generate_DataSet_Img2Img.py
```
